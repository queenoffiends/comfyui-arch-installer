# ComfyUI GUI Installer for Arch Linux (Fish Shell Edition)

A one-click, GUI-driven installer for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) on Arch Linux, built with `zenity` dialogs and producing a ready-to-use [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) launch script.

## What it does

1. **Checks dependencies** — verifies `zenity`, `git`, and `python` are installed, and offers to install any missing ones via `pacman` (requires `sudo`).
2. **Prompts for an install directory** via a native file picker.
3. **Prompts for your GPU type** — NVIDIA, AMD, or CPU-only — and installs the matching PyTorch build.
4. **Clones ComfyUI**, creates a Python virtual environment, installs PyTorch and ComfyUI's dependencies, all with a live progress bar.
5. **Generates a Fish launcher** (`run_comfyui.fish`) in the install directory so you can start ComfyUI with a single command afterward.
6. **Reports success or failure** in a dialog, with a log file at `/tmp/comfyui_install.log` for troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Arch Linux (or an Arch-based distro with `pacman`)
- [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) (only needed to *run* ComfyUI afterward — the installer itself is `bash`)
- `sudo` access, if `zenity`, `git`, or `python` aren't already installed

## Usage

```bash
https://github.com/queenoffiends/comfyui-arch-installer.git
cd /path/to/install/dir/ComfyUI/
chmod +x install_comfyui.sh
./install_comfyui.sh
```

Follow the dialogs: pick an install directory, pick your GPU type, and let it run. Once finished, start ComfyUI with:

```fish
/path/to/install/dir/ComfyUI/run_comfyui.fish
```

## Known issues & troubleshooting

### `Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction` on startup

This comes from `kornia_rs`, a dependency pulled in by ComfyUI's built-in post-processing nodes. The published `kornia_rs` wheel is compiled assuming at least AVX/AVX2/FMA3 CPU support. On older CPUs (pre-2011, before AVX existed) — or in some VM/container setups where the hypervisor doesn't pass those CPU flags through to the guest — importing it crashes the whole process before ComfyUI even starts.

**Check if this affects you:**

```fish
grep flags /proc/cpuinfo | head -1 | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E 'avx|fma'
```

If this prints nothing, your CPU (or your VM's exposed CPU flags) lacks AVX/FMA support.

**Fix — remove the offending package** (a few post-processing nodes will be unavailable, everything else works normally):

```fish
source venv/bin/activate.fish
pip uninstall -y kornia kornia_rs
```

If your CPU *does* support AVX2/FMA (the grep above prints something) but you're still crashing, try rebuilding `kornia_rs` from source instead, which requires a Rust toolchain (`cargo`):

```fish
pip install kornia-rs --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all:
```

### GPU not fully utilized / "does not include kernels for this GPU" warning

The default installer runs `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio`, which currently pulls a CUDA 13.0 build. That build drops kernel support for older NVIDIA compute capabilities (e.g. Pascal-generation cards like the GTX 10-series, compute capability 6.x). If you see a warning like:

```
Your installed torch==X.Y.Z+cu130 does not include kernels for this GPU.
```

Reinstall PyTorch against an older CUDA build that still supports your card, e.g.:

```fish
source venv/bin/activate.fish
pip install torch==2.14.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

(Check [pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the CUDA build matching your specific GPU generation.)

## Log file

All install output is captured in `/tmp/comfyui_install.log`. If the installer reports a failure, check this file first for the underlying error.
